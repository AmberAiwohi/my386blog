Hi! My name is Amber, and I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. I'm currently studying statistics with an emphasis in data science at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I'm also studying to receive a business management minor. I'm new to Github but am excited to learn the ins and outs as I explore and post my findings. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, or feedback. Mahalo!
