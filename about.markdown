Hi! My name is Amber, and I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. I'm currently studying statistics with an emphasis in data science at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I'm new to Github, but I'm excited to learn the ins and outs as I post assignments from my STAT386 class on here. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, or feedback. Mahalo!
