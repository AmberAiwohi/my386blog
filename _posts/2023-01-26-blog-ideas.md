# Future Blog Post Plans
## 1. "How-to" post
I plan to review installing and utilizing one of my favorite packages in R. I'm still debating which package I want to dive into, but whether it's ggplot, the classic tidyverse, or a mystery package, I want to show some of my favorite features from the package. 

## 2. Book Review
The book I plan to read and review is *Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy* by Cathy O'Neil. 

## 3. Main Class Project
Last semester I worked as a research assistant for the dean of undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University Richard Gill. My main goal was to analyze the D-grades, E-grades, and withdrawl grades of students at BYU and try to find common characteristics between students who were receiving poor grades. I'm hoping to get permission to use that data for my main class project.
